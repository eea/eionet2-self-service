The app will be available to all Eionet related teams (i.e. main Eionet team, ETC teams and others).

## Features

- Update current user account data (with the exception of the attributes that can be updated only by an user with a higher authority - Admin or NFP) 

## Getting started

The application is available as a "tab" application in the MS Teams Eionet 2.0 teams space.
